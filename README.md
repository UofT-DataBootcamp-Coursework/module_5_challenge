# Module 5 Challenge - PyBer


## Challenge Overview

1. Technical Analysis Deliverable 1: A DataFrame that summarizes the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type.

2. Technical Analysis Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week.

3. Delivering Results: A written report of your results, saved in a README.md document on your GitHub repository.

## 3. Written Analysis

### Backgroung and Results

- Describe the purpose, or the reason, you did this assignment.

- How did you analyze the data to create the technical deliverables?

- What can be said about the summary DataFrame and multiple-line graph with respect to the ride-sharing data among the different city types? Include images of the summary DataFrame table and the multiple-line graph in these results.

- A short summary of the results.

### Challenges Encountered and Overcome

- What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.

Experienced challenges with final formatting of the line plot, specifically with re-labelling the x-ticks to the desired outcome.

After spending some time researching different ways to change the x-tick structure, witnessed a classmate explaining the same struggle to the instructor during Tuesday office hours, and paid attention to the solution the instructor provided. To ensure I was not simply copying code, spend some time afterwards re-reviewing the technical literature the instructor recommended to review to ensure I thoroughly understood the correction to my code.

### Recommendations and Next Steps

- Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
- Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
- What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?


Additional analysis related to (A) the number of fares per city type per day, as well as (B) the number of fares per city type per hour are recommended to provide further insight in the disparaty amongst city types.

(A) To perform this analysis, will need to calculate the number of fares per city type per day using 

(B)
